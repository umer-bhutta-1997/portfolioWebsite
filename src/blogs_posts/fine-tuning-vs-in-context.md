# Fine-Tuning vs. In-Context Learning: Customizing LLMs for Your Workflow
![Fine Tune VS In-Context learning](/fine-tuning-vs-in-context.png)
## Introduction

Imagine you're building an AI assistant for doctors to use in patient care. You have a powerful large language model (LLM) at your disposal, but you need it to speak the language of medicine and follow clinical guidelines with precision. How do you **customize** this LLM for your specific workflow? Two broad strategies emerge: you can **fine-tune** the model’s internal parameters on medical data, or you can design clever **prompts** (in-context learning) to coax the right behavior without changing the model at all. There’s also a middle ground: **parameter-efficient tuning** methods like LoRA, which let you fine-tune a model cheaply by adjusting only small additional weights.

In this post, we’ll compare **full fine-tuning**, **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA)**, and **in-context learning (prompt engineering)** as approaches to tailor LLMs. We’ll focus on practical differences in scalability, cost, speed, performance, and when each method is most suitable. Along the way, we’ll explore examples in healthcare – from patient triage to medical note summarization – to illustrate how these techniques play out in real-world scenarios. The goal is to provide an intermediate-level understanding (for ML engineers, researchers, and enthusiasts) of how to pick the right customization approach for your needs, balancing formal explanation with an approachable narrative.

## Full Fine-Tuning: Adapting All Weights for Custom Tasks

Full fine-tuning is the “all-in” approach: you take a pre-trained LLM and **update all of its parameters** on your task-specific data. Essentially, the model “goes back to school” on new examples, adjusting its millions or billions of weights to learn patterns unique to your task. For example, you might fine-tune a general language model on a corpus of clinical notes so that it better understands medical terminology and can generate more accurate diagnoses or summaries.

Fine-tuning often **achieves higher accuracy on specialized tasks** than prompting alone. The model can acquire **new knowledge** or vocabulary not present in its original training – a critical factor in domains like healthcare, where you might have jargon or clinical facts the base model never saw. Fine-tuning can also enforce specific **output formats or styles**, such as consistent clinical summary structures.

However, full fine-tuning requires a **substantial dataset** and significant **computational resources**. Updating a massive model is memory and time intensive, often needing multi-GPU setups or specialized hardware. Additionally, fully fine-tuned models become **less flexible**; adapting to a new domain typically requires retraining from scratch. There is also a risk of **catastrophic forgetting**, where the model’s general knowledge degrades.

In practice, full fine-tuning is ideal when you **need the highest possible performance** on a crucial task and have the data and budget to support it. Many enterprise applications in healthcare use full fine-tuning to maximize accuracy and reliability.

## Parameter-Efficient Tuning: LoRA and Lightweight Adaptation

What if you could get most of the benefits of fine-tuning without updating every single weight? **Parameter-efficient tuning** methods like **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** add a small number of new trainable parameters without altering the original model weights.

LoRA can **dramatically reduce the number of parameters that need training**. For instance, for a 175B-parameter model, LoRA can cut trainable parameters by a factor of 10,000× and reduce memory requirements 3-fold. Despite this frugal approach, LoRA often achieves performance **on par with full fine-tuning** on many benchmarks.

LoRA’s lightweight adapters can be **kept separate** from the base model, allowing you to maintain one core LLM and several domain-specific adapters. This modularity makes serving multiple healthcare tasks more scalable and helps preserve the base model’s general abilities.

While LoRA may have a slight edge in resource efficiency, **full fine-tuning generally still outperforms it by a small margin** on very complex domains. However, when resources or data are limited, LoRA offers a compelling balance of performance and cost.

## In-Context Learning: Prompt Engineering for On-the-Fly Customization

**In-context learning** (prompt engineering) involves **crafting the input** to guide the model’s behavior, without any training. You can provide instructions, examples, or templates in the prompt to teach the model on the fly.

A classic example is **few-shot prompting**:

```
Patient: I have had a fever and cough for two days.
Triage category: URGENT

Patient: My knee has been mildly sore after running, no swelling or fever.
Triage category: NON-URGENT

Patient: I have a severe headache and blurred vision after a fall.
Triage category:
```

By showing the model sample inputs and outputs, you can steer its classification.

Prompt engineering is **fast and flexible**: no dataset preparation or training time is required. However, performance is bounded by the base model’s capabilities, and prompts can be sensitive to wording. Context length limits and per-request overhead may also pose challenges.

- **LoRA:** Efficient adaptation; preserves general language ability.
- **Prompting:** Flexible style control; zero training; may need post-editing.

### Clinical Note Generation

## Choosing the Right Approach

- **Full Fine-Tuning**: Choose when **maximum accuracy** and **domain-specific knowledge** are critical and resources are available.
- **Parameter-Efficient (LoRA)**: Opt for when you need **strong performance** with **limited compute/data**, and want modular adapters.
- **In-Context Learning**: Ideal for **rapid prototyping**, **minimal infrastructure**, and when using hosted LLM APIs you cannot fine-tune.

Often, teams **combine methods**: start with prompts, then move to LoRA or full fine-tuning, and continue using prompts to guide the fine-tuned model. By understanding these options, you can tailor LLMs to healthcare workflows—or any domain—in the most effective way.
