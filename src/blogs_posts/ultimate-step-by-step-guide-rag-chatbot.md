# Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot from Scratch
![Image Not Found](/blog_image_1.png "Optional title")

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with information retrieval systems to provide accurate, context-aware responses grounded in external data. Unlike vanilla chatbot architectures that rely solely on the model’s pretraining knowledge (which may be limited or outdated), RAG chatbots dynamically fetch relevant documents or knowledge snippets and feed them into the LLM at inference time. This guide walks you through building your own RAG chatbot from the ground up using Python, OpenAI’s API (or any LLM), and a vector database like FAISS.

## 1. Overview of RAG Architecture

A typical RAG pipeline consists of three main components:

1. **Document Store**  
   A collection of text documents (FAQs, manuals, knowledge bases) you want the chatbot to draw from.

2. **Retriever**  
   Embeds documents and user queries into vector representations and finds the most relevant documents via similarity search.

3. **Generator**  
   An LLM that, given the retrieved documents and the user’s query, composes a coherent answer.

```
User Query → Retriever → Top-k Docs → Generator → Response
```

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **OpenAI API key** (or another LLM endpoint)  
- **Libraries:**  
  ```bash
  pip install openai faiss-cpu sentence-transformers langchain
  ```  
- **Data:** A folder of text or Markdown files containing your domain knowledge.

---

## 3. Step 1: Prepare Your Documents

Organize your knowledge base into individual text files under a directory:

```
knowledge_base/
├── faq.txt
├── product_manual.md
└── support_articles/
    ├── onboarding.md
    └── troubleshooting.md
```

Load and chunk these documents so they’re not too long (e.g., 500 tokens per chunk):

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from pathlib import Path

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
docs = []

for file in Path("knowledge_base").rglob("*.md"):
    content = file.read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    for chunk in text_splitter.split_text(content):
        docs.append({"text": chunk})
```

---

## 4. Step 2: Embed and Store in FAISS

Use a sentence-transformer model to convert text chunks into vectors, then index them in FAISS:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Load embedding model
embedder = SentenceTransformer("sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2")

# Encode all chunks
texts = [doc["text"] for doc in docs]
embeddings = embedder.encode(texts, convert_to_numpy=True)

# Build FAISS index
dim = embeddings.shape[1]
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dim)
index.add(embeddings)

# Persist index and mapping
faiss.write_index(index, "faiss_index.bin")
np.save("texts.npy", np.array(texts, dtype=object))
```

---

## 5. Step 3: Implement the Retriever

Define a function that, given a user query, embeds it and retrieves the top-k most similar document chunks:

```python
def retrieve(query: str, k: int = 5):
    q_vec = embedder.encode([query], convert_to_numpy=True)
    distances, indices = index.search(q_vec, k)
    return [texts[idx] for idx in indices[0]]
```

---

## 6. Step 4: Compose the Prompt and Call the LLM

Once you have your top-k chunks, you’ll construct a prompt that includes the context and the user’s question. Here’s an example using OpenAI’s API:

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

def generate_answer(query: str):
    docs = retrieve(query, k=5)
    context = "

".join(docs)
    prompt = (
        "You are a knowledgeable assistant. Use the following context to answer the question.

"
        f"Context:
{context}

"
        f"Question: {query}
Answer:"
    )

    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=256,
        temperature=0.2,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()
```

## 7. Step 5: Build a Simple Chat Interface

You can expose your RAG chatbot via a CLI, web app, or messaging platform. Here’s a minimalist CLI loop:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Welcome to the RAG Chatbot. Type 'exit' to quit.")
    while True:
        user_input = input("\nYou: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ("exit", "quit"):
            break
        answer = generate_answer(user_input)
        print(f"Bot: {answer}")
```

For a web interface, consider using **Flask** or **FastAPI**:

```python
# app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Query(BaseModel):
    question: str

@app.post("/chat")
def chat(q: Query):
    answer = generate_answer(q.question)
    return {"answer": answer}
```

---

## 8. Step 6: Evaluation and Fine-Tuning

1. **Quality Checks:** Solicit test queries, measure relevance and correctness.  
2. **Parameter Tuning:** Adjust \`k\`, chunk sizes, and LLM temperature.  
3. **Feedback Loop:** Log conversations to refine your document store and retriever.

---

## 9. Next Steps

- **Vector Database Upgrade:** Migrate to a managed service like **Pinecone** or **Weaviate** for scaling.  
- **Embeddings Optimization:** Experiment with domain-specific embedding models.  
- **Streaming Responses:** Leverage streaming APIs for lower latency.  
- **Multimodal RAG:** Integrate images or tabular data into the retrieval pipeline.

## Conclusion

Building a RAG chatbot empowers you to deliver accurate, up-to-date information by combining retrieval and generation. With just a few lines of code, you can set up a pipeline that scales with your knowledge base and continually improves as you add more documents.
